General Style:
* Use <xref ref="...">Activity</xref> to refer to a <task> inside an <activity> (but from outside that activity).
* Use <xref ref="..." text="type-local" /> to refer to a <task> inside an <activity> from another task within that same activity.
* Use <xref ref="..." text="local">Rule/Axiom A/S</xref> to refer to v.space axioms.


Specific notes:
* Different versions of "TFAE to invertibility" should be titled:
	<title> Characterizations of invertibility </title>


Schema Reminders:
* In <activity> and <task>,  <statement> is only needed if there will be parallel <hint> or <solution> or etc.


MathJax settings:
* Could globally (or is it only per page?) change MathJax interline spacing by adding something like
	<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
		MathJax.Hub.Register.StartupHook("mml Jax Ready",function () {
			MathJax.ElementJax.mml.math.prototype.defaults.lineleading = "1.5ex";
		});
	</script>

  before the script that loads MathJax.js itself in order to change the default interline space value.  (It is "1ex" by default.)
  --> Could maybe add something to compile-html.sh to insert this into every html file, if necessary.
