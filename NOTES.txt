General Style:
* Use <xref ref="...">Activity</xref> to refer to a <task> inside an <activity> (but from outside that activity).
* Use <xref ref="..." text="type-hybrid" /> to refer to a <task> inside an <activity> from another task within that same activity.
* Use <xref ref="..." text="local">Rule/Axiom A/S</xref> to refer to v.space axioms.

Specific notes:
* Different versions of "TFAE to invertibility" should be titled:
	<title> Characterizations of invertibility </title>
f

Schema Reminders:
* In <activity> and <task>,  <statement> is only needed if there will be parallel <hint> or <solution> or etc.
