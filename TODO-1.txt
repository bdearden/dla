* Matrix-times-column as linear combination of columns:
  column on right overlaid on rows of matrix on left,
  instead of rows of matrix on left overlaid on column on right.
* s/find/determine/ in abstract v space activities
* Determinant of A=[a] activity needs to be more lead-by-the-hand:
  The inverse of matrix A=[a] is A^-1=[1/a], but only if ________.
  So the number that *determines* if A=[a] is invertible is _______.
  (Make sure your number in the second blank is always a number.)
