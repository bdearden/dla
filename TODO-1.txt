* s/find/determine/ in abstract v space activities
* Easier proof of "invertible product has invertible factors":
  Let X be inverse of MN. Then X(MN)=I => (XM)N=I => N invertible
  by "one-sided inverse implies inverse" fact.
  And similarly with X on the other side for M.
* Determinant of A=[a] activity needs to be more lead-by-the-hand:
  The inverse of matrix A=[a] is A^-1=[1/a], but only if ________.
  So the number that *determines* if A=[a] is invertible is _______.
  (Make sure your number in the second blank is always a number.)
* First activity in elementary matrix activity set needs an A matrix
  where it will be more obvious what the pattern is?
  (Right now it looks like entries in second row of A are just getting
  "switched around.")
  Maybe A has first row 1 2 3 4,
  and second row 1 0 1 0, or maybe 1 1 1 1, or ...?
* Activity leading to matrix mult needs more guidance.
  IDEA: *Before* introducing the matrix equation Ax=b...
  . Ask them to express the equations a=7, b=-2 as a single matrix equation.
  . Ask them to express the two system equations as a single matrix equation.
  . *Now* relate this to Ax=b.
