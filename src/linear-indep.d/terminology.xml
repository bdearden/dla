	<title><term>linearly dependent set of vectors</term></title>
	<!-- \index{linearly!dependent} -->
	<p>
	a set of vectors in which there is at least one example of a vector that can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors in the set; we also consider the set of vectors consisting of <em>only</em> the zero vector as linearly dependent

	<title><term>linearly independent set of vectors</term></title>
	<!-- \index{linearly!independent} -->
	<p>
	a set of vectors that is not linearly dependent; <ie /> a set of vectors in which <em>no</em> vector can be expressed as a linear combination of other vectors in the set
