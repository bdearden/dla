<title>Basic properties of determinants</title>

<p>The following justifies our definition of the determinant as the <em>common</em> value of all cofactor expansions of a matrix.</p>

<theorem>
	<statement><p>
	Every cofactor expansion of a given square matrix, whether along a row or a column, evaluates to the same value.
	</p></statement>
	<proof><p>
	The proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this course; instead see
	<xref ref="reference-dummit-foote-alg,reference-hoff-kunze" />.
	</p></proof>
</theorem>

<p> Finally, let's record the determinants of special forms of matrices we discussed in <xref ref="section-det-concepts" />. However, we omit the proofs since we have already considered in detail the patterns behind the proofs in that earlier discussion. </p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-det-special-forms"><statement><p><ol>
	<li xml:id="proposition-det-special-forms-triangular">
	For a matrix that is diagonal or triangular, the determinant is equal to the product of the diagonal entries.
	</li>
	<li> <m>\det \zerovec = 0</m> for a square zero matrix. </li>
	<li xml:id="proposition-det-special-forms-identity"> <m>\det I = 1</m>. </li>
</ol></p></statement></proposition>
